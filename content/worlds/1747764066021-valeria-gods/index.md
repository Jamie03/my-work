### Seraphim Archangel

**Seraphim Archangel**, ruler of the plane of *Aether*, is a celestial being of immense power and grace. With burnished-brass skin, spun-gold hair, and wings that gleam like sunlight, he wields a flaming sword whose righteous fury banishes darkness. His voice thunders like a thousand trumpets, inspiring hope and striking fear into evil hearts.

---

### Inpu

**Inpu**, Lord of Embalming and Keeper of the Dead, appears as a jackal-headed humanoid in gold-and-blue ceremonial garb. His knowledge of death and the afterlife commands both reverence and dread. Piercing eyes seem to peer into the soul, and every step echoes beyond the mortal plane.

---

### Solomon As-Sajdah

**Solomon As-Sajdah**, the Grim Reaper of souls, guides the departed to their final rest. Cloaked in raven-black robes, his glinting eyes watch over dark forces that would corrupt the dead. Though fearsome in duty, rare acts of mercy speak to a deeper compassion beneath his hood.

---

### The Great Salamandria

In the primordial war that forged Valeria, **The Great Salamandria** roamed as a dragon of living flame. Her sunlike scales and diamond-bright eyes brought warmth and light, yet her pride made her untamable. Vanished after the war’s end, she remains a symbol of raw power and mystery.

---

### Lady Fortuna

**Lady Fortuna**, weaver of mortal destinies, appears in visions as either radiant with scarlet hair or cloaked in shadow. Through prayers and offerings, mortals seek her favor—yet her blessings and curses follow her inscrutable will, for she is fate incarnate.

---

### Arkus the Horned

**Arkus the Horned**, ruler of the Nether, stands amid infernal fire in coal-black armor etched with ancient runes. His jagged horns and malevolent sneer mark him as master of demons. A cunning strategist, he wields honeyed poison in words and summons abyssal hordes in battle.

---

### Reigadyrth

**Reigadyrth**, the amethyst-scaled noble dragon, inspired the founding of the Purple Dragon Knights. With thunderous roars and molten flame, she defended mortals from tyranny. Her wisdom endures in the knights’ code of honor and justice.

---

### Todesfall

**Todesfall**, brother to Reigadyrth, personifies death’s finality. Once a glorious dragon, a self-made curse blackened his scales and ragged wings. Now he dwells in solitude, awaiting the end of dragons and the world they shaped.

---

### Aegir

**Aegir**, king of the frost giants atop Skathi Peak, towers clad in shimmering fur. His hammer of living ice sends shockwaves that freeze enemies solid. Just and honorable to oath-keepers, he unleashes the storm’s full fury upon traitors.
