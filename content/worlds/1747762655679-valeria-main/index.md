## Major Cities

### Maleketh

Nestled in the prosperous northeast, **Maleketh** is Valeria’s merchant capital. Its spires and grand marketplaces hum with trade, and the city’s fortunes rest on four **High Families**:

- **Barlowe**: Controls transportation across the realm  
- **Megadome**: Built and maintains the city’s infrastructure  
- **Evermont**: Oversees the distribution of wine and spirits  
- **Saka**: Owns the food and hospitality industries  

At the city’s heart stands **Mount Doloro**, the tallest peak in Valeria, said to house the Dwarven King and his sons in hidden forges. Nearby, the **Great Colosseum**—named for the legendary warrior Maleketh Stallion—hosts fierce battles between gladiators and beasts.

Despite its wealth, Maleketh teems with danger. Criminal networks and smugglers prey on the unwary. The **Purple Dragon Knights** maintain order, but the shadowy **Syndicates** constantly test their authority. Venture through crowded streets at your own risk—secrets in Maleketh can be deadly.

### Felgrand

Located at the crossroads of Valeria’s regions, **Felgrand** is a *steampunk metropolis* ruled by the criminal **Syndicates**. Innovation thrives so long as profits flow, and the skyline bristles with airships and steam-powered vehicles.

- **Syndicates**: Loose alliances of rival crime lords  
- **Black Market**: Hidden beneath the streets; goods and services of dubious legality  

Newcomers risk robbery or worse in Felgrand’s alleys, but savvy traders can strike it rich. The city’s thrilling unpredictability makes it both dangerous and irresistible.

### Timmaeus

In the frozen northwest lies **Timmaeus**, a city of stone walls and icy winds. Its people are hardy, bound by tradition and protected by the **Purple Dragon Knights**, who maintain their headquarters here.

- **Skathi Peak**: Valeria’s second-highest mountain, home to the fierce *Mighty Frost* tribe  
- **College of Timmaeus**: Premier institution for magical study  

Though knowledge and magic flourish, dark forces and savage beasts lurk beyond the walls. Only the resourceful survive the frigid wastes.

### Boljaw

**Boljaw**, the City of Canals, spans the tropical marshes of the southwest. Boats, not carts, ply its waterways, and every district blends magic with engineering marvels.

1. **Old Quarter**  
   - Narrow, twisting canals and leaning buildings  
   - A maze only locals can navigate  

2. **New Quarter**  
   - Broad waterways and towering mansions  
   - Home to the wealthy elite  

3. **Docklands**  
   - Bustling ports and merchant ships  
   - Beware of cutpurses and smugglers  

The **Palace of Boljaw** overlooks it all, where the Duke and council rule. Hidden treasures and lost artifacts await those daring enough to brave the canals.

### Yarlford

In the southeastern wilderness lies **Yarlford**, a rugged countryside governed by Mayor **Cleopatra Cretari**, a tiefling descended from famed hunters. The region is dotted with cozy cottages and lively markets, but life here demands strength and resilience.

- **Mayor Cleopatra Cretari**: Crimson-skinned leader from a line of hunters  
- **Wildlife**: Deer and rabbits; wolves, trolls, and other predators  
- **Terrain Hazards**: Treacherous forests, fierce storms, and bandit ambushes  

Under Mayor Cretari’s leadership, Yarlford’s hardy folk strive to thrive, honoring their ancestors’ legacy in a land as beautiful as it is unforgiving.
