## Alliances

Valeria’s stability hinges on powerful bonds between its defenders, rulers, and underworld powers. From the chivalric **Purple Dragon Knights**, sworn to uphold justice in every city, to the shadowy **Syndicates** of Felgrand, and the influential **High Families of Maleketh**, each alliance shapes the political and social landscape. In the border town of Taloncroft, the **Talon Hunters** stand as an independent force, protecting the frontier from beasts and dark magic. Together, these factions uphold—or threaten—the delicate balance of power across Valeria.
