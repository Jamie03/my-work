## Introduction

When was the last time you saw your tabletop group light up with fresh ideas? Designing unforgettable characters and crafting epic plot twists draws all types of players towards **Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs)**. The *creative freedom* offered in TTRPG systems is unique and can only be experienced when partaking in the medium. However, as I explored in my previous article on [A New Era for Tabletop Role-Playing Games]({{% ref "/posts/1747160072917-AI-in-Creative-Writing" %}}), creative hurdles often hold players back despite having that freedom. This issue is further complicated by the fact that every playgroup has its own unique setups and ways of working.

To better understand how players and Game Masters (GMs) experience that creative magic, I ran a survey to gather nuanced perspectives on creative expression and its challenges. Over thirty seasoned hobbyists shared their backgrounds, triumphs, frustrations, and hopes for tools to enhance creativity and make the next campaign more vivid.

## Creative Freedom and Player Agency

It turns out that, by and large, this community feels creatively free. Nearly **three-quarters** rated their ability to express ideas at the table as a top-tier 4 or 5 out of 5, and an even greater share felt they had *agency* in shaping the story. That sense of ownership is the lifeblood of TTRPGs: when players know their choices matter, they become more invested in the adventure and the narrative.

Yet even in a creative paradise, clouds can gather. On average, participants rated the impact of *creative hurdles* around the midpoint, suggesting that frustrations still linger with varied intensity. When asked which challenges they frequently come across, three stand out:

1. **Time Constraints**: Nearly half struggle to carve out preparation time consistently.  
2. **Complex Rules & Mechanics**: Over a third find dense rulebooks a creative drag.  
3. **Narrative Bottlenecks**: One in three feel the GM’s vision sometimes dominates, leaving personal ideas sidelined.

Beyond those top-line stats, many mentioned *session fatigue* and *clashing player styles*. Only a select few felt they never hit a creative snag, proving that even veteran groups can use a helping hand.

## Digital Companions and the AI Question

Digital tools are already woven into many campaigns and setups. From character-building apps like [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) to world-building platforms like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or [World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/), about **80%** of our respondents tap into some online aid. Yet when it comes to *AI* specifically, the jury is split: just under half are open to AI’s help, while the rest remain cautious.

For those ready to experiment, they outlined the following use cases:

- Ambient Sounds & Music Generation (**88%** interest)  
- World-Building Assistance (**75%**)  
- NPC Backstories (**81%**)  
- Automated Character Sheets (**69%**)  
- Only about half would welcome AI-driven plot suggestions, which could warrant further investigation.

## Looking Ahead: A Deeper Dive

The survey makes one thing clear: players and GMs love the creative freedom of tabletop play and already lean on digital tools, but when it comes to AI, there’s a real sense of caution. Many worry that an over-eager algorithm could dilute the human spark that makes every session unique. Understanding those fears is essential if we want AI to be a trusted companion rather than an oversized game master.

To get to the bottom of this, I decided to conduct a focused follow-up study that will explore how analog methods and digital aids coexist around the table and probe how generative AI might shoulder routine tasks—like character-sheet upkeep or world-building structure—without stealing the spotlight from player-driven storytelling. By focusing on these questions, I hope to uncover the insights needed to build tools that truly enhance the shared adventure.
