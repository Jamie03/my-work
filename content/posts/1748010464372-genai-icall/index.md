## A Deeper Look at CALL and Early ICALL

Computers entered language teaching in the 1960s with simple drill-and-practice programs: fill-in-the-blank exercises that offered immediate correct/incorrect feedback. This *Behaviourist CALL* phase laid the groundwork for using technology in the classroom. By the 1990s, *Integrative CALL* harnessed the internet and multimedia to provide authentic content like videos, audio, and text to enhance learner motivation and exposure to real-world language. Yet, personalization remained minimal.

The early 2000s saw the birth of **ICALL**, where natural language processing **(NLP)** enabled more intelligent feedback. ICALL systems could automatically correct grammar, suggest vocabulary, and generate simple exercise variations. Despite these advances, interactions were mostly rule-based or template-driven, and true open-ended dialogue was still out of reach.

## Generative AI Enters the Chat

The introduction of Transformer-based models like **GPT-3** in 2020 and services like **ChatGPT**, brought a leap forward. These models generate coherent, context-aware language, that allows:

- **Longer, more natural dialogues**  
- **On-demand explanations and exercises**  
- **Adaptive language complexity**

Since ChatGPT uses natural language to communicate, language learning was one of the key application areas focused on. However, its application is largely still being experimented on, with three leading the charge:

### Meet Your AI Tutor

A 2024 study by [Panagiotidis](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1455392.pdf) showed that LLM-powered chatbots enhance learner engagement by providing instant, personalized feedback. Modern AI tutors blend flexibility with guidance:

- **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)**: Offers conversation practice, grammar corrections, and explanations on any topic.  
- **[Duolingo Max](https://www.duolingo.com/max)**: Uses GPT-4 to power role-plays and step-by-step grammar coaching.  
- **[Speak](https://www.speak.com/)**: Focuses on spoken practice that listens to your voice, then provides pronunciation and grammar feedback.

These tutors adapt to your level and interests, giving you a judgment-free space to practice. However, chatbots offer little to no features for learners who prefer an immersive experience. This is particularly troublesome for learners who would much rather learn through practice. Thankfully, another application targets that specific problem.

### Scenario-Based Learning in a New Light

Scenario-based language learning immerses learners in realistic conversations, a key method for transferring classroom knowledge to real-world use. Traditionally, role-plays and simulations required extensive scripting, but generative AI changes that:

> **“Let’s role-play a hotel check-in in French.”**

With generative AI, learners can engage in open-ended role-play conversations where the AI assumes a role in the scenario and responds unpredictably yet appropriately. This technique is already being applied to certain services and local setups:

- **[Pi](https://pi.ai/)**: An empathetic bot that can impersonate countless roles, from car dealers to tour guides.  
- **[NotebookLM](https://workspace.google.com/products/notebook-lm)** + **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)**: One generates scenario prompts; the other conducts interactive mock interviews.  
- **[Character.AI](https://beta.character.ai/)**: Create custom characters to practice specific contexts and scenarios.

This flexibility fills a critical gap: authentic, contextualized practice without the content-creation headache. However, it is not uncommon to see scenario-based learning as a gimmick that is used sparingly. Since any scenario can be generated, it lacks a way to get the user to imagine scenarios or motivate them to learn. Thus, a third application area is introduced.

## Gamification Gets Smarter

In 2025, [DaCosta’s work](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=142450) demonstrated how adding ChatGPT to text-adventure games creates immersive language quests, letting learners explore and interact naturally as they play. The flexibility afforded by generative AI helps revitalize new and existing language-learning games:

- **Interactive stories** that adapt to your choices to further enhance immersion.  
- **Custom challenges** emphasize your target grammar and vocabulary, keeping your level in check.  
- **Non-playable Characters (NPCs)** respond to free-form input instead of pre-determined selections.

This dynamic content keeps you engaged and motivated without overwhelming you. With generative AI, a learner could potentially craft their learning regimen based on their commitment and effort goals.

## But, Why do AI-Powered Scenarios Matter?

Traditional ICALL tools often fall short on **authenticity**, **adaptivity**, and **engagement**. Generative scenario-based learning addresses these longstanding ICALL gaps:

1. **Personalization**: Scenarios adjust to your level and interests in real-time.  
2. **Authenticity**: Practice real-world tasks like job interviews, doctor visits, negotiations.  
3. **Instant feedback**: AI highlights errors and suggests better phrasing.  
4. **Scalability**: Instructors describe a scene; AI builds it.  
5. **Engagement**: Endless variations keep motivation high.

The goal of using these tools is to move past memorizing phrases, and start learning to think in the language by yourself!

## Wrapping Up and What's Next

We’re at the dawn of a new era in **Second Language Acquisition** where AI-driven, scenario-based ICALL systems can provide truly immersive, personalized, and engaging practice. As platforms evolve, expect to see even smarter applications of generative AI that immerse you in language learning. However, the question still remains:

> *"How would such a tool look?"*

I got you covered! In this new series of articles, I'll go over a research project I did with my colleagues at the **University of Salzburg** on Utilizing Generative AI for Scenario-Based Second Language Acquisition! In the next section, I'll explain how we designed a tool with second-language learners in mind and how we iterated and improved it over time!
