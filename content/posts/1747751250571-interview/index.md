## Introduction

In recent years, we have witnessed an unprecedented expansion in digital tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) platforms due to the pandemic and lockdown procedures across the globe. At the same time, generative AI technologies continue to encroach upon the realm of creativity, from AI text and image generation used for fantasy character creation to live session-note automation for summaries. However, the adoption of these tools isn't as prevalent as other digital tools. As mentioned in my previous article on [Gathering Community Insights on Tabletop Creativity]({{% ref "/posts/1747666608330-pre-survey" %}}), while most hobbyists have integrated digital tools into their gaming ecosystems, less than half are considering generative AI to address creative challenges. I wanted to investigate this apprehension further by conducting a more in-depth user study by interviewing experienced players and Game Masters (GMs) to address these questions:

1. **Digital Integration:** How do players and GMs blend traditional methods with digital tools during gameplay?
2. **AI Assistance:** In what ways can generative AI relieve routine burdens while preserving the integrity of creative processes?

This user study delves into how they navigate this hybrid analog–digital landscape and how they envision AI as a collaborative partner in the creative storytelling process.

## Who’s in Our Party?
Four brave adventurers were purposely sampled for this study based on their TTRPG experience in both roles:

- **The Scout:** Primarily a player with 3 years of experience; uses analog notes alongside [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) and [Roll20](https://roll20.net/); minimal AI for image generation.  
- **The Knight:** Newly appointed GM with a total experience of 4 years; background in game design; digital-first, using [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/), [Discord](https://discord.com/) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/); AI only for technical support, not creativity.  
- **The Mage:** Experienced GM of 8 years; extensive digital ecosystem including [Roll20](https://roll20.net/), [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/); actively uses AI-generated text and art.  
- **The Hermit:** Seasoned GM with 12 years of experience; prefers hybrid sessions using analog tools (maps, dice towers) alongside digital platforms such as [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) and [Miro](https://miro.com/); AI used strictly for administrative tasks.

The goal of this sampling was to get perspectives from various roles and experience levels while considering their unique gaming setups. With this in mind, let’s jump into the fray and see what awaits these four.

## Blending Dice and Devices

When face-to-face sessions dried up in 2020, virtual play rocketed into the mainstream, shining a spotlight on virtual tabletops (VTTs) like [Roll20](https://roll20.net/). **The Scout and Hermit** described missing the tactile feeling of physical dice rolls and hand-scrawled maps for in-person immersion. Yet they were open to using digital initiative trackers and dynamic stat blocks when their sessions went online. They shared moments of scribbling faction notes on paper one second, then clicking “Next” on a VTT macro the next. Having largely returned to analog sessions, **the Hermit** still retains digital conveniences adopted during lockdown.

## AI as the New Quartermaster

Our digital tool specialists, **the Knight and Mage**, have carved out distinct AI roles at their tables. **The Mage** leans into generative text and image tools to help them sketch NPCs and locales, then refines the output to preserve each campaign’s tone. By contrast, **the Knight** uses AI strictly for menial tasks, such as automated loot tables, session reminders, and rule lookups. Across the interviews, each participant expressed excitement for AI-enhanced workflows, like automatically transcribing session audio into recaps or creating fantasy maps that perfectly fit the scenario the players find themselves in, potentially saving precious preparation time.

## Human Creativity First

Despite the allure of instant content generation, every party member insisted that AI must be a supporting actor, not the star. They highlighted the need for:

- **Customizable output:** Maps, loot tables, or character backstories must be tweakable to ensure each campaign retains its unique flavor.
- **Ethical considerations:**  
  - Transparency in how AI assets are generated  
  - Fairness and bias checks  
  - User agency and ownership of creative content

Concerns about generic, one-size-fits-all generators mirror broader debates over AI-asset ownership and creative bias. *Ethical frameworks* emphasize that transparency, fairness, and user agency are non-negotiable when using generative AI in collaborative storytelling.

## Conclusion and Future Directions

Our four adventurers show that the sweet spot of modern TTRPGs lies where the clatter of physical dice meets the click of digital tools. AI tools should retain a supportive role rather than become the dominant creative force, unless explicitly prompted. Whether it’s the Hermit switching between hand-drawn maps and VTT macros or the Mage refining AI-designed NPCs into bespoke story elements, everyone agrees: **AI must listen before it speaks**.

Imagine a co-creative AI that not only suggests *campaign-appropriate* plot hooks and dynamic world details, but also exposes the logic behind each idea, enforces bias checks, wrapped in an *ethical framework* that puts you in control. That’s the vision I want to explore in the next article, where we dive into designing an **AI-assisted world-building tool** built to spark richer, more collaborative storytelling at every roll of the dice!
