## Introduction

**What happens when design becomes a form of protest?** When the tools we use to navigate our digital lives are reimagined not just for convenience, but for change? These are the questions that have shaped the evolution of activism within Human-Computer Interaction.

Design has become a medium for dissent, dialogue, and disruption. Researchers and practitioners use interactive technology to shed light on injustice, mobilize communities, and support grassroots organizing. From open-source communication tools used in protests to immersive storytelling platforms that humanize complex social issues, HCI is proving itself to go beyond the functional.

## A Foundation in Activist Design

The roots of design activism in HCI started back in the 80s, with [participatory design movements in Scandinavia](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=d43c53c6bf9fdf757fdba28d908d768ec3425bb6). These early efforts focused on democratizing technology by involving workers directly in the design of their tools. This influence brought an ethical stance to HCI: technology design was no longer seen as value-neutral, but rather as an opportunity to empower communities and challenge power imbalances in workplaces and beyond. 

Researchers like [Carl DiSalvo](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2341007) introduced ideas like adversarial design and agonistic design, which use design to provoke, confront, and challenge the status quo. The idea is that not all design needs to solve a problem; some design can simply make us think, feel, and act.

The concept of these ideas sparked the creation of frameworks like [Design Justice](https://designjustice.mitpress.mit.edu/) by Sasha Costanza-Chock, which have shifted how we think about equity in the design process. The core idea? Those most affected by design should have a central role in shaping it. Design Justice reminds us that creating with communities is essential.

## Where Design Meets Protest

During the Hong Kong protests, activists used the Bluetooth-based app [Bridgefy](https://bridgefy.me/) which allows users to communicate without internet access. The app was used as a [workaround against government censorship](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/09/04/hong-kong-protesters-are-using-this-mesh-messaging-app--but-should-they-trust-it/), where a case of low-tech ingenuity made high-impact activism possible.

Other examples include how protest art and graphic design have elevated movements like [Extinction Rebellion](https://rebellion.global/). [From vivid colors to memorable symbols](https://crackmagazine.net/article/long-reads/extinction-rebellion-graphic-design-activism/), their striking visuals served as a key strategy to gain awareness for their radical activism.

And then there’s the digital storytelling platform [HerStoryTold](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173931), co-designed with reproductive rights activists in Ireland. Built to share personal abortion narratives, it served as both a safe space and a powerful advocacy tool during a pivotal national referendum. What struck me most was how the platform emerged from genuine collaboration with the community it served.

## Inclusion, Accessibility, and Public Engagement

We’re no longer talking about design just in terms of screen sizes and color contrast. Today, it’s about ensuring marginalized voices are heard and empowered through the design process. Whether it’s designing apps in multiple languages or adding sign language interpretation to live protests, activists are embracing a broader definition of accessibility.

Technology also allows activism to be more immersive. Groups like [Amplifier](https://amplifier.org/) are layering [augmented reality onto posters](https://amplifier.org/campaigns/amplifier-ar/) to create interactive public experiences. Others are using immersive storytelling, which lets people step into the shoes of refugees or experience climate change through virtual reality.

> *These approaches remind us that design isn’t just what we see on screens. It’s how people feel, engage, and respond. It’s an invitation to a cause.*

## What This Means for Us as Designers

> *So, why does all of this matter?*

As designers and researchers, we are uniquely positioned to support change. We have the tools to prototype solutions, but also the responsibility to question the systems we’re designing within. Activist HCI evolved from being a niche subject to a part of the field’s evolution.

This broader understanding is what guided our work with [Fridays for Future Salzburg](https://fridaysforfuture.at/). Working within resource constraints, we aimed to co-create a public artifact that could draw attention and invite participation, without relying on expensive tech.

**This article marks the launch of a new series:** a deep dive into my journey of exploring activism through the lens of design and HCI. I’ll walk you through how I partnered with grassroots groups, dove head-first into artivist projects, and wrestled with the question of how design can amplify underrepresented voices.
