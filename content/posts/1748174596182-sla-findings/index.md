## Introduction
Generative AI has opened new frontiers for Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL), offering the ability to produce vast quantities of contextually relevant, grammatically correct practice material on demand. By leveraging large-scale language models, educators can craft scenarios that adapt to real-world communicative goals, increasing learner motivation and authenticity of practice. Contemporary research highlights the potential of these tools to democratize language education through dynamic content generation and personalized feedback loops.

To translate this potential into a usable tool, we embarked on [three weekly user-testing sessions]({{% ref "/posts/1748099731762-sla-findings" %}}) with German learners, following a test-talk-improve cycle. Each round revealed critical insights: 
1. From the need for forgiving speech-to-text and dynamic dialogue in the first iteration.
2. To interface polish and in-context corrections in the second.
3. Finally, to features supporting long-term engagement in the third. 
However, these iterations gave us more than just feedback on our tool. Our journey gave us a glimpse into the minds of language learners and their typical ways of working.

After three rounds of testing, dozens of interviews, and hours of observation, we started seeing recurring issues, feature requests, and user behaviors that gave us a clearer picture of what works (and what doesn’t) in an AI-powered language learning tool.

From those insights, we developed a set of practical design guidelines grounded in real user feedback and tested through iteration. They address three key areas: how the AI is prompted, how the tool supports language learning, and how the overall user experience comes together.

## Context Is Everything

Let’s start with the heart of the tool: the generative AI itself.

One of the most consistent issues users flagged was that the AI sometimes felt too generic and flat. The scenarios didn’t always match expectations, and the responses didn’t feel personal. We realized that **prompting matters a lot** in how the AI behaves.

- The system needs **detailed, meaningful context** to generate more relevant, human-like interactions.  
- Give users a way to **customize** the AI or choose from **tailored scenario options**.  
- When you’re juggling multiple models (e.g., one for speech recognition, another for visuals), maintain **consistency in prompt structure**.  
- A useful strategy: have a central model like [GPT-4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) handle prompt generation for all sub-models to maintain a consistent tone, intent, and structure.

> **Bottom line:** You get out what you put in. **Better prompts = better conversations.**

## Adapt, Don’t Overwhelm

No two learners are alike, and the tool needs to reflect that.

One of the biggest opportunities we saw was around **adaptivity**. Users wanted the challenge level of conversations to match their current proficiency, not some fixed standard.

- Implement an **adaptive difficulty system** that adjusts grammar, vocabulary, and scenario complexity over time.  
- Provide a **user-controlled toggle** so learners can set their own challenge level, balancing personalization with autonomy.  
- For translation support, **less is more**: most participants preferred quick lookups for individual words or short phrases rather than full-sentence translations.

## Be Familiar, Forgiving, and Fun

Even the smartest AI won’t help much if the interface feels clunky or confusing. Thoughtful UX design makes all the difference.

- Leverage **familiar structures** like messaging apps: clear message bubbles, intuitive icons, and responsive layouts that users already understand.  
- Offer **manual speech control** (press-to-talk) so users can pause, think, and then speak to boost learners' comfort and confidence.  
- Include a **“hover to translate”** feature (inspired by [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/) and [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)) for quick, inline word lookups without breaking the flow.

> These design choices **should** help reduce friction and build confidence to foster an experience that feels more like learning with a helpful guide and less like wrestling with a chatbot.

## Conclusion: From Prototype to Possibility

This project began as a question: **how can generative AI make language learning more personal, immersive, and approachable?** Through three iterations, we explored that question with real learners. While the prototype is far from perfect, the insights we gained have been invaluable.

We saw firsthand how *flexible* input methods, scenario-based conversations, and AI-powered feedback can support more confident and creative language practice. At the same time, we encountered the familiar challenges of learner motivation, limited emotional depth in AI, and the need for more intuitive, engaging design. 

> *The design guidelines we’ve shared are not just reflections of what we built. They're a foundation for what comes next.*

Looking forward, we hope this work serves as a **launchpad** for new ideas in AI-assisted language learning and beyond. Whether applied to storytelling, game design, or live educational prototyping, the principles here can inform the next generation of tools that put learners at the center.

*This is just the beginning.*
