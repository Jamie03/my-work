## Introduction

**Tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs)** have long held a special place in the hearts of storytellers, gamers, and fantasy lovers. It features a unique experience that blends **structured rules** with **creative freedom**, creating a *shared universe* where players and a Game Master (GM) create stories together. As new technology reshapes how we play, it is only a matter of time until **generative artificial intelligence (AI)** joins the party.

When applied to TTRPGs, this tool can transform how games are prepared and played. By complementing human creativity, AI introduces a new era of dynamic and personalized storytelling.

## From Dice to Digital: A History of Play

TTRPGs began with pen and paper, dice, and raw imagination. Over time, players and GMs adopted digital tools into their preparation and gameplay. There are three parts to this transition:

- **Analog Origins**  
  Early games of Dungeons &amp; Dragons relied heavily on physical rulebooks, drawn maps, and group imagination.
- **Online Platforms Emerge**  
  Tools like [Roll20](https://roll20.net) and [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com) digitized many aspects of gameplay, allowing playgroups to connect virtually.
- **Hybrid Playstyles**  
  Today, many campaigns combine analog charm with digital convenience, such as dynamic maps paired with physical dice.

This gradual shift laid the foundation for integrating even more advanced tools like generative AI.

## Imagination at the Core

*Creativity* is the beating heart of every role-playing game. It is what drives compelling narratives and introduces **unique characters**, which often serve as a reflection of our experiences. Unique to TTRPGs, creativity manifests in scenarios such as:

- **Collaborative Storytelling**  
  The storyline isn’t dictated—it’s negotiated by the table.
- **The GM’s Role**  
  The GM crafts the setting, controls the rhythm, and reacts to player unpredictability.
- **Player-Driven Twists**  
  Characters’ decisions continually reshape the world and the narrative.

The interactions between players and GMs make TTRPGs more than just games—they are living stories that ebb and flow.

## Where Creativity Gets Stuck

Despite their *rich potential*, traditional TTRPGs are not without friction. This friction can manifest from varied skill gaps among players, especially those not comfortable with improvising, to *improv fatigue* stemming from burnout due to creativity demands from players and GMs. A lack of structure or memory tools can also lead to unresolved plot holes or forgotten arcs. These challenges can compound on top of each other and deter players' creativity. 

These challenges can be separated into two categories based on which aspect of the game they occur: **preparation vs. gameplay challenges**. Preparation challenges occur during the campaign or session planning stages of the game, while gameplay challenges occur during the sessions themselves. While there can be an overlap between the two categories, how we address these creative challenges can differ significantly by way of the interactions that are affected. These interactions can be seen through who is affected by these issues: with preparation often dealing with the *self*, while gameplay often dealing with the *group and its dynamics*.

## How AI Fits at the Table

*Generative AI* has the potential to address these challenges by sharing the creative load. To understand its impact, it’s essential to know how it operates:

- **How It Works**  
  AI tools are trained on vast datasets to generate language, images, or ideas. Think [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) writing NPC dialogue or [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com) creating landscapes.
- **AI Tools in TTRPGs**  
  Some popular applications include [Dungeon Alchemist](https://www.dungeon-alchemist.com) for map creation, GPT-based prompt generators, and various virtual assistants.

The introduction of generative AI shifted its role from mere automation to true creative expansion—much like how Photoshop revolutionized digital art.

### Bridging Skill Gaps with AI Tools

With the widespread use of text-based tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), GMs have started incorporating them into their digital ecosystems with varying levels of creative control. While traditional GMs tend to leave AI with logistical roles like scheduling sessions and creating outlines and summaries, others are open to letting AI take the creative reins by incorporating them in world-building and character creation. Common examples include creating a dungeon based on a core concept from the GM and letting AI suggest traps and puzzles, or creating factions based on an established deity from the world lore. Instead of replacing the GM, AI can enhance their imagination with varied levels of creative control.

The tool can also benefit players. Due to the nature of the player's role within the story, they often focus heavily on the creation and development of their characters. AI provides solutions through *character builders* that can add depth to a concept or generate new ones from scratch. *Personality quizzes* and *trait selectors* are often used to make character creation faster while introducing some depth that the player can build upon. Large language models (LLMs) can also be tailored for this specific purpose through training with specialized datasets. Even with minimal prompting, a complex character idea can be generated that the player can shape into their own. This empowers new players to participate confidently and creatively while giving more veteran players new ideas to work with.

### Live Sessions, Real-Time Collaboration

One of the most exciting aspects of generative AI is its ability to adapt in real time during a gaming session. During sessions, it can help GMs and players adapt to unexpected turns, generate spontaneous content, and keep the story flowing without breaking immersion.

- **Instant Descriptions**  
  Generate vivid locales, NPCs, and items on the fly.
- **Reactive World-Building**  
  Adjust crowd behavior, summon unexpected encounters, or introduce plot twists as players explore.
- **Improvised Plot Hooks**  
  Offer side quests or character arcs that align with the established story.

By responding instantly and intelligently, AI turns improvisation into *true* collaboration, keeping both GMs and players fully immersed.

## Creative Power vs. Creative Control

While generative AI can enhance storytelling, it also introduces risks that can undermine the core of TTRPGs if not handled carefully. When AI takes too much creative control, it can overshadow the GM’s vision and reduce player agency, making choices feel less meaningful. Improvised elements may not align with the campaign’s tone or continuity, and relying on AI for key moments can sap the spontaneity and emotional depth that make tabletop role-playing compelling in the first place.

Outside the narrative, broader concerns like content ownership, data privacy, and algorithmic bias come into play. It's often unclear who owns AI-generated material, especially when using proprietary platforms, and user inputs could be stored or repurposed without clear consent. If not properly monitored, AI tools can replicate harmful stereotypes embedded in their training data, affecting the inclusivity and integrity of the game. AI can be a powerful co-creator, but it demands a cautious and intentional approach.

## What Comes Next? A Creative Crossroads

Generative AI is opening new doors for creativity in TTRPGs, from rich world-building to real-time improvisation. But with these tools come important questions:

1. **How do we keep storytelling spontaneous?**  
2. **How do we ensure AI enhances rather than directs the game?**

The challenge lies in using AI thoughtfully, as a creative partner rather than a narrative crutch. After all, while code may shape the tools, the heart of every TTRPG remains undeniably human. As we explore what’s possible, one question guides us:

*How will you let generative AI enhance your next adventure?*
