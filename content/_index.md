## 👋 About Me

**Greetings! my name is JM, and I aim to design a better tomorrow.**
**By exploring new technologies, I strive to build innovative tools and craft thoughtful experiences that enrich our daily lives.**

**We learn something new every day, but I believe it's our responsibility to share and apply those insights to drive positive change. I'm always looking to collaborate with like-minded individuals and groups, so if you'd like to work together, send me an invite!**

## 🧙‍♂️ Creative Pursuits

**In my free time, I love to build fantasy worlds for an ongoing tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) campaign with friends and colleagues.**
**I'm drawn to classical high-fantasy settings inspired by Tolkien, with a particular focus on political intrigue to drive storytelling.**

**One day, I hope to compile these adventures into a short novel, featuring a collection of themes and stories meant to inspire other hobby writers like myself.**
