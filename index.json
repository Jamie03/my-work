At the same time, generative AI technologies continue to encroach upon the realm of creativity, from AI text and image generation used for fantasy character creation to live session-note automation for summaries. However, the adoption of these tools isn\u0026rsquo;t as prevalent as other digital tools. As mentioned in my previous article on Gathering Community Insights on Tabletop Creativity, while most hobbyists have integrated digital tools into their gaming ecosystems, less than half are considering generative AI to address creative challenges. I wanted to investigate this apprehension further by conducting a more in-depth user study by interviewing experienced players and Game Masters (GMs) to address these questions:\nDigital Integration: How do players and GMs blend traditional methods with digital tools during gameplay? AI Assistance: In what ways can generative AI relieve routine burdens while preserving the integrity of creative processes? This user study delves into how they navigate this hybrid analog‚Äìdigital landscape and how they envision AI as a collaborative partner in the creative storytelling process.\nWho‚Äôs in Our Party? # Four brave adventurers were purposely sampled for this study based on their TTRPG experience in both roles:\nThe Scout: Primarily a player with 3 years of experience; uses analog notes alongside D\u0026amp;D Beyond and Roll20; minimal AI for image generation. The Knight: Newly appointed GM with a total experience of 4 years; background in game design; digital-first, using Foundry VTT, Discord and Figma; AI only for technical support, not creativity. The Mage: Experienced GM of 8 years; extensive digital ecosystem including Roll20, D\u0026amp;D Beyond and Notion; actively uses AI-generated text and art. The Hermit: Seasoned GM with 12 years of experience; prefers hybrid sessions using analog tools (maps, dice towers) alongside digital platforms such as Spotify and Miro; AI used strictly for administrative tasks. The goal of this sampling was to get perspectives from various roles and experience levels while considering their unique gaming setups. With this in mind, let‚Äôs jump into the fray and see what awaits these four.\nBlending Dice and Devices # When face-to-face sessions dried up in 2020, virtual play rocketed into the mainstream, shining a spotlight on virtual tabletops (VTTs) like Roll20. The Scout and Hermit described missing the tactile feeling of physical dice rolls and hand-scrawled maps for in-person immersion. Yet they were open to using digital initiative trackers and dynamic stat blocks when their sessions went online. They shared moments of scribbling faction notes on paper one second, then clicking ‚ÄúNext‚Äù on a VTT macro the next. Having largely returned to analog sessions, the Hermit still retains digital conveniences adopted during lockdown.\nAI as the New Quartermaster # Our digital tool specialists, the Knight and Mage, have carved out distinct AI roles at their tables. The Mage leans into generative text and image tools to help them sketch NPCs and locales, then refines the output to preserve each campaign‚Äôs tone. By contrast, the Knight uses AI strictly for menial tasks, such as automated loot tables, session reminders, and rule lookups. Across the interviews, each participant expressed excitement for AI-enhanced workflows, like automatically transcribing session audio into recaps or creating fantasy maps that perfectly fit the scenario the players find themselves in, potentially saving precious preparation time.\nHuman Creativity First # Despite the allure of instant content generation, every party member insisted that AI must be a supporting actor, not the star. They highlighted the need for:\nCustomizable output: Maps, loot tables, or character backstories must be tweakable to ensure each campaign retains its unique flavor. Ethical considerations: Transparency in how AI assets are generated Fairness and bias checks User agency and ownership of creative content Concerns about generic, one-size-fits-all generators mirror broader debates over AI-asset ownership and creative bias. Ethical frameworks emphasize that transparency, fairness, and user agency are non-negotiable when using generative AI in collaborative storytelling.\nConclusion and Future Directions # Our four adventurers show that the sweet spot of modern TTRPGs lies where the clatter of physical dice meets the click of digital tools. AI tools should retain a supportive role rather than become the dominant creative force, unless explicitly prompted. Whether it‚Äôs the Hermit switching between hand-drawn maps and VTT macros or the Mage refining AI-designed NPCs into bespoke story elements, everyone agrees: AI must listen before it speaks.\nImagine a co-creative AI that not only suggests campaign-appropriate plot hooks and dynamic world details, but also exposes the logic behind each idea, enforces bias checks, wrapped in an ethical framework that puts you in control. That‚Äôs the vision I want to explore in the next article, where we dive into designing an AI-assisted world-building tool built to spark richer, more collaborative storytelling at every roll of the dice!\n","date":"20 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-work/posts/1747751250571-interview/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Exploring Hybrid Setups \u0026 AI for Tabletop Creativity","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"20 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-work/tags/generative-ai/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Generative AI","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-work/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"20 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-work/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-work/tags/ttrpg/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"TTRPG","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-work/tags/user-study/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"User Study","type":"tags"},{"content":"Photo by Joseph Ogbonnaya on Unsplash\nIntroduction # When was the last time you saw your tabletop group light up with fresh ideas? Designing unforgettable characters and crafting epic plot twists draws all types of players towards Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs). The creative freedom offered in TTRPG systems is unique and can only be experienced when partaking in the medium. However, as I explored in my previous article on A New Era for Tabletop Role-Playing Games, creative hurdles often hold players back despite having that freedom. This issue is further complicated by the fact that every playgroup has its own unique setups and ways of working.\nTo better understand how players and Game Masters (GMs) experience that creative magic, I ran a survey to gather nuanced perspectives on creative expression and its challenges. Over thirty seasoned hobbyists shared their backgrounds, triumphs, frustrations, and hopes for tools to enhance creativity and make the next campaign more vivid.\nCreative Freedom and Player Agency # It turns out that, by and large, this community feels creatively free. Nearly three-quarters rated their ability to express ideas at the table as a top-tier 4 or 5 out of 5, and an even greater share felt they had agency in shaping the story. That sense of ownership is the lifeblood of TTRPGs: when players know their choices matter, they become more invested in the adventure and the narrative.\nYet even in a creative paradise, clouds can gather. On average, participants rated the impact of creative hurdles around the midpoint, suggesting that frustrations still linger with varied intensity. When asked which challenges they frequently come across, three stand out:\nTime Constraints: Nearly half struggle to carve out preparation time consistently. Complex Rules \u0026amp; Mechanics: Over a third find dense rulebooks a creative drag. Narrative Bottlenecks: One in three feel the GM‚Äôs vision sometimes dominates, leaving personal ideas sidelined. Beyond those top-line stats, many mentioned session fatigue and clashing player styles. Only a select few felt they never hit a creative snag, proving that even veteran groups can use a helping hand.\nDigital Companions and the AI Question # Digital tools are already woven into many campaigns and setups. From character-building apps like D\u0026amp;D Beyond to world-building platforms like Obsidian or World Anvil, about 80% of our respondents tap into some online aid. Yet when it comes to AI specifically, the jury is split: just under half are open to AI‚Äôs help, while the rest remain cautious.\nFor those ready to experiment, they outlined the following use cases:\nAmbient Sounds \u0026amp; Music Generation (88% interest) World-Building Assistance (75%) NPC Backstories (81%) Automated Character Sheets (69%) Only about half would welcome AI-driven plot suggestions, which could warrant further investigation. Looking Ahead: A Deeper Dive # The survey makes one thing clear: players and GMs love the creative freedom of tabletop play and already lean on digital tools, but when it comes to AI, there‚Äôs a real sense of caution. Many worry that an over-eager algorithm could dilute the human spark that makes every session unique. Understanding those fears is essential if we want AI to be a trusted companion rather than an oversized game master.\nTo get to the bottom of this, I decided to conduct a focused follow-up study that will explore how analog methods and digital aids coexist around the table and probe how generative AI might shoulder routine tasks‚Äîlike character-sheet upkeep or world-building structure‚Äîwithout stealing the spotlight from player-driven storytelling. By focusing on these questions, I hope to uncover the insights needed to build tools that truly enhance the shared adventure.\n","date":"19 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-work/posts/1747666608330-pre-survey/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Community Insights on Tabletop Creativity","type":"posts"},{"content":"Photo by Clint Bustrillos on Unsplash\nIntroduction # Tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) have long held a special place in the hearts of storytellers, gamers, and fantasy lovers. It features a unique experience that blends structured rules with creative freedom, creating a shared universe where players and a Game Master (GM) create stories together. As new technology reshapes how we play, it is only a matter of time until generative artificial intelligence (AI) joins the party.\nWhen applied to TTRPGs, this tool can transform how games are prepared and played. By complementing human creativity, AI introduces a new era of dynamic and personalized storytelling.\nFrom Dice to Digital: A History of Play # TTRPGs began with pen and paper, dice, and raw imagination. Over time, players and GMs adopted digital tools into their preparation and gameplay. There are three parts to this transition:\nAnalog Origins\nEarly games of Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons relied heavily on physical rulebooks, drawn maps, and group imagination. Online Platforms Emerge\nTools like Roll20 and D\u0026amp;D Beyond digitized many aspects of gameplay, allowing playgroups to connect virtually. Hybrid Playstyles\nToday, many campaigns combine analog charm with digital convenience, such as dynamic maps paired with physical dice. This gradual shift laid the foundation for integrating even more advanced tools like generative AI.\nImagination at the Core # Creativity is the beating heart of every role-playing game. It is what drives compelling narratives and introduces unique characters, which often serve as a reflection of our experiences. Unique to TTRPGs, creativity manifests in scenarios such as:\nCollaborative Storytelling\nThe storyline isn‚Äôt dictated‚Äîit‚Äôs negotiated by the table. The GM‚Äôs Role\nThe GM crafts the setting, controls the rhythm, and reacts to player unpredictability. Player-Driven Twists\nCharacters‚Äô decisions continually reshape the world and the narrative. The interactions between players and GMs make TTRPGs more than just games‚Äîthey are living stories that ebb and flow.\nWhere Creativity Gets Stuck # Despite their rich potential, traditional TTRPGs are not without friction. This friction can manifest from varied skill gaps among players, especially those not comfortable with improvising, to improv fatigue stemming from burnout due to creativity demands from players and GMs. A lack of structure or memory tools can also lead to unresolved plot holes or forgotten arcs. These challenges can compound on top of each other and deter players\u0026rsquo; creativity.\nThese challenges can be separated into two categories based on which aspect of the game they occur: preparation vs. gameplay challenges. Preparation challenges occur during the campaign or session planning stages of the game, while gameplay challenges occur during the sessions themselves. While there can be an overlap between the two categories, how we address these creative challenges can differ significantly by way of the interactions that are affected. These interactions can be seen through who is affected by these issues: with preparation often dealing with the self, while gameplay often dealing with the group and its dynamics.\nHow AI Fits at the Table # Generative AI has the potential to address these challenges by sharing the creative load. To understand its impact, it‚Äôs essential to know how it operates:\nHow It Works\nAI tools are trained on vast datasets to generate language, images, or ideas. Think ChatGPT writing NPC dialogue or Midjourney creating landscapes. AI Tools in TTRPGs\nSome popular applications include Dungeon Alchemist for map creation, GPT-based prompt generators, and various virtual assistants. The introduction of generative AI shifted its role from mere automation to true creative expansion‚Äîmuch like how Photoshop revolutionized digital art.\nBridging Skill Gaps with AI Tools # With the widespread use of text-based tools like ChatGPT and Gemini, GMs have started incorporating them into their digital ecosystems with varying levels of creative control. While traditional GMs tend to leave AI with logistical roles like scheduling sessions and creating outlines and summaries, others are open to letting AI take the creative reins by incorporating them in world-building and character creation. Common examples include creating a dungeon based on a core concept from the GM and letting AI suggest traps and puzzles, or creating factions based on an established deity from the world lore. Instead of replacing the GM, AI can enhance their imagination with varied levels of creative control.\nThe tool can also benefit players. Due to the nature of the player\u0026rsquo;s role within the story, they often focus heavily on the creation and development of their characters. AI provides solutions through character builders that can add depth to a concept or generate new ones from scratch. Personality quizzes and trait selectors are often used to make character creation faster while introducing some depth that the player can build upon. Large language models (LLMs) can also be tailored for this specific purpose through training with specialized datasets. Even with minimal prompting, a complex character idea can be generated that the player can shape into their own. This empowers new players to participate confidently and creatively while giving more veteran players new ideas to work with.\nLive Sessions, Real-Time Collaboration # One of the most exciting aspects of generative AI is its ability to adapt in real time during a gaming session. During sessions, it can help GMs and players adapt to unexpected turns, generate spontaneous content, and keep the story flowing without breaking immersion.\nInstant Descriptions\nGenerate vivid locales, NPCs, and items on the fly. Reactive World-Building\nAdjust crowd behavior, summon unexpected encounters, or introduce plot twists as players explore. Improvised Plot Hooks\nOffer side quests or character arcs that align with the established story. By responding instantly and intelligently, AI turns improvisation into true collaboration, keeping both GMs and players fully immersed.\nCreative Power vs. Creative Control # While generative AI can enhance storytelling, it also introduces risks that can undermine the core of TTRPGs if not handled carefully. When AI takes too much creative control, it can overshadow the GM‚Äôs vision and reduce player agency, making choices feel less meaningful. Improvised elements may not align with the campaign‚Äôs tone or continuity, and relying on AI for key moments can sap the spontaneity and emotional depth that make tabletop role-playing compelling in the first place.\nOutside the narrative, broader concerns like content ownership, data privacy, and algorithmic bias come into play. It\u0026rsquo;s often unclear who owns AI-generated material, especially when using proprietary platforms, and user inputs could be stored or repurposed without clear consent. If not properly monitored, AI tools can replicate harmful stereotypes embedded in their training data, affecting the inclusivity and integrity of the game. AI can be a powerful co-creator, but it demands a cautious and intentional approach.\nWhat Comes Next? A Creative Crossroads # Generative AI is opening new doors for creativity in TTRPGs, from rich world-building to real-time improvisation. But with these tools come important questions:\nHow do we keep storytelling spontaneous? How do we ensure AI enhances rather than directs the game? The challenge lies in using AI thoughtfully, as a creative partner rather than a narrative crutch. After all, while code may shape the tools, the heart of every TTRPG remains undeniably human. As we explore what‚Äôs possible, one question guides us:\nHow will you let generative AI enhance your next adventure?\n","date":"13 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-work/posts/1747160072917-ai-in-creative-writing/","section":"","summary":"","title":"A New Era for Tabletop Role-Playing Games","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"13 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-work/tags/game-master-tools/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Game Master Tools","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-work/tags/real-time-collaboration/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Real-Time Collaboration","type":"tags"},{"content":" ‚ú® Welcome to Valeria # Where magic and technology collide, and legends come to life.
